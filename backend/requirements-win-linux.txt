# Windows/Linux requirements with CUDA PyTorch
# GPU acceleration for RTX 50 series (Blackwell) and older NVIDIA GPUs

# PyPI as primary, nightly as secondary for torch packages only

# PyTorch nightly with CUDA 12.8 (required for RTX 50 series / Blackwell GPUs)
# torchvision pinned here so pip doesn't backtrack through all stable versions
torch>=2.11.0.dev
torchaudio>=2.11.0.dev
torchvision>=0.22.0.dev

# ONNX Runtime with GPU support (falls back to CPU if no GPU)
onnxruntime-gpu>=1.16.0

# Pin transitive deps that cause pip backtracking
numba>=0.60.0
llvmlite>=0.43.0

# Base requirements (after PyTorch to prevent CPU torch override)
